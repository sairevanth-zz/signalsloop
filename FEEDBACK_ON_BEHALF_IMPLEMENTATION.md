# Feedback on Behalf Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "Submit Feedback on Behalf" feature for SignalsLoop, similar to the existing "Vote on Behalf" functionality. This allows sales teams and admins to submit customer feedback directly into the system with priority tracking and customer notifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`add-feedback-on-behalf-schema.sql`)
Created a comprehensive database schema including:
- **feedback_metadata table**: Stores metadata about feedback submitted on behalf of customers
  - Links to posts table via `post_id`
  - Stores admin information (who submitted it)
  - Customer details (email, name, company)
  - Priority levels (must_have, important, nice_to_have)
  - Feedback source tracking
  - Internal notes (admin-only)
  - Customer notification tracking
- **Database functions**:
  - `get_customer_feedback_history()`: Get all feedback for a specific customer
  - `get_company_feedback_insights()`: Analytics for company-level feedback
- **Database view**: `admin_feedback_on_behalf` for dashboard analytics
- **RLS policies**: Secure access control for project owners

### 2. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/feedback/on-behalf/route.ts`)
Created a secure API endpoint that:
- Authenticates the admin user
- Validates project ownership
- Creates a new post with the feedback
- Stores metadata about the submission
- Optionally sends customer notification emails
- Tracks analytics for reporting

### 3. UI Component (`src/components/FeedbackOnBehalfModal.tsx`)
Built a comprehensive modal form with:
- Customer information fields (email, name, company)
- Feedback title and description
- Priority selection (must_have, important, nice_to_have)
- Feedback source tracking (sales call, meeting, support ticket, etc.)
- Internal notes field (admin-only)
- Customer notification toggle
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and success feedback

### 4. Board Integration (`src/app/[slug]/board/page.tsx`)
Added the feature to the main board page:
- "Submit on Behalf" button visible only to project owners
- Button positioned next to the regular "Submit Feedback" button
- Green color scheme to differentiate from regular feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Automatically refreshes the board after successful submission

### 5. Dashboard Page (`src/app/[slug]/settings/feedback/page.tsx`)
Created a dedicated dashboard to view all feedback submitted on behalf:
- Statistics cards showing:
  - Total feedback count
  - Must Have priority count
  - Important priority count
  - Customers notified count
- Detailed list view showing:
  - Feedback title and description
  - Customer information
  - Admin who submitted it
  - Priority and source
  - Status badges
  - Internal notes (highlighted)
  - Timestamp

### 6. Settings Integration (`src/app/[slug]/settings/page.tsx`)
Added a new "Feedback" tab in project settings:
- Located between "Votes" and "Import" tabs
- Links to the feedback dashboard
- Consistent design with other settings sections

## How to Use

### For Admins/Sales Teams:
1. **Submit Feedback on Behalf**:
   - Go to your project board
   - Click "Submit on Behalf" button (green, next to "Submit Feedback")
   - Fill in customer details
   - Enter the feedback title and description
   - Select priority level
   - Choose feedback source
   - Add internal notes (optional)
   - Choose whether to notify customer
   - Submit

2. **View Submitted Feedback**:
   - Go to Settings → Feedback tab
   - Click "Open Feedback Dashboard"
   - View all feedback with filters and details

### Database Setup:
Run the SQL migration script:
```sql
-- In your Supabase SQL Editor
\i add-feedback-on-behalf-schema.sql
```

This will:
- Create the `feedback_metadata` table
- Set up indexes for performance
- Create helper functions
- Configure RLS policies
- Create analytics views

## Key Features

✅ **Secure Authentication**: Only project owners can submit feedback on behalf
✅ **Customer Tracking**: Links feedback to specific customers and companies
✅ **Priority System**: Three-tier priority (must_have, important, nice_to_have)
✅ **Source Tracking**: Know where feedback came from (sales calls, meetings, etc.)
✅ **Internal Notes**: Private notes visible only to admins
✅ **Customer Notifications**: Optional email notifications to customers
✅ **Analytics Ready**: Built-in views and functions for reporting
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
✅ **Status Tracking**: See which feedback items are open, planned, in progress, or done

## Differences from Vote on Behalf

1. **Creates Full Posts**: Unlike votes, this creates complete feedback items (posts)
2. **No Duplicate Prevention**: Can submit multiple feedback items from the same customer
3. **Richer Content**: Includes title and description, not just a vote
4. **Status Tracking**: Feedback items have status (open, planned, etc.)
5. **Green Color Scheme**: Uses green/teal colors vs blue/purple for votes

1. `add-feedback-on-behalf-schema.sql` - Database schema
