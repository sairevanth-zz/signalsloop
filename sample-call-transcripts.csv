Acme Corp,"Hi, this is Sarah from Acme Corp. We've been using your product for about 3 months now and honestly, it's been fantastic. The dashboard analytics have saved our team at least 5 hours per week. We're actually looking to expand - can we add 10 more seats? Also, the integration with Slack has been a game-changer for us.",15000,negotiation,DEAL-001
TechStart Inc,"Hey team, this is Mike from TechStart. Look, I need to be honest - we're comparing you guys with Productboard and Canny right now. Your pricing is a bit higher, but I do like the AI features. Can you match their price? We're a small startup with limited budget but we really need this kind of tool.",8000,evaluation,DEAL-002
Global Retail LLC,"This is Jennifer from Global Retail. I'm calling because we've been experiencing some issues with the mobile app. When I try to load the feedback board on my iPhone, it takes forever and sometimes crashes. This is really frustrating because my team needs to check feedback on the go. If this isn't fixed soon, we might need to reconsider our subscription.",25000,at_risk,DEAL-003
CloudNine Software,"Hi there, Marcus here from CloudNine. Just wanted to give you some feedback - we LOVE the new AI categorization feature. It's so accurate! One thing though - we'd really love dark mode support. Our developers work late nights and the bright white screen is hard on the eyes. Any plans for that?",12000,active,DEAL-004
FinServe Partners,"This is Lisa from FinServe. We're in the final stages of our evaluation and your product is our top choice. However, our security team needs SOC 2 compliance documentation. Can you send that over? Also, we need single sign-on with Okta - is that available? If you can confirm these two things, we can sign the contract this week.",50000,closing,DEAL-005
NextGen Startup,"Hey, David from NextGen here. We signed up last month but to be honest, we're not really using the product. It's just too complex for our small team. We don't need all these enterprise features - we just want simple feedback collection. I'm thinking about cancelling unless there's a simpler tier available.",3000,churning,DEAL-006
MegaCorp Industries,"Good morning, this is Patricia from MegaCorp. We've been a customer for 2 years now and I have to say, you guys keep impressing us. The new Jira integration is exactly what we needed. We're actually looking to roll this out to 3 more departments. Can we schedule a call to discuss enterprise pricing?",85000,expansion,DEAL-007
StartupHub,"Hi, I'm Alex from StartupHub. First time caller here. We found you guys through a blog post about feedback tools. I really like what I see but I'm wondering - how does your product compare to Pendo? We're early stage and trying to understand what makes you different. Also, do you offer any startup discounts?",5000,discovery,DEAL-008
Healthcare Plus,"This is Dr. Williams from Healthcare Plus. We need a HIPAA-compliant solution for collecting patient feedback. Can your platform handle PHI data? We're working with sensitive medical information and compliance is non-negotiable. Also, we'd need a BAA signed before we can proceed.",35000,qualification,DEAL-009
EduTech Academy,"Maria speaking from EduTech Academy. Our students and teachers have been giving great feedback through your platform. However, we're running into an issue with the voting system - some users are reporting they can't vote more than once even after the daily limit resets. Can someone look into this? We have over 500 active users counting on this.",18000,support,DEAL-010
