## 📱 Mobile-Specific Classes Added

```css
/* Touch Targets */
.min-touch-target { min-width: 44px; min-height: 44px; }

/* Touch Optimization */
.tap-highlight-transparent { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; }
.touch-manipulation { touch-action: manipulation; }

/* Scrolling */
.momentum-scroll { -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; overflow-y: auto; }

/* Safe Areas (for notched devices) */
.safe-top { padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top); }
.safe-bottom { padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom); }
.safe-left { padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left); }
.safe-right { padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right); }
```

## 🔧 How to Use New Components

### Mobile Navigation
```tsx
import { MobileNav } from '@/components/ui/mobile-nav';

<MobileNav 
  user={user}
  onSignOut={handleSignOut}
  currentPath={pathname}
/>
```

### Bottom Navigation
```tsx
import { BottomNav } from '@/components/ui/bottom-nav';

<BottomNav 
  projectSlug="my-project"
  onNewPost={() => setShowPostForm(true)}
/>
```
