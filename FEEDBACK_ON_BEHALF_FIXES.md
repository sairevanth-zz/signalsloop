# Feedback on Behalf - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing board_id in API
**Problem**: The API was trying to create posts without the required `board_id` field, causing the insert to fail.

**Solution**: Updated `/api/feedback/on-behalf` to:
- Query the boards table to get the board_id for the project
- Include both `project_id` and `board_id` when creating posts
- Return proper error if board is not found

### 2. ‚úÖ Dashboard Query Issues
**Problem**: The feedback dashboard query was using complex nested joins that might not work properly with Supabase.

**Solution**: Updated `src/app/[slug]/settings/feedback/page.tsx` to:
- First fetch all posts for the project
- Then fetch feedback metadata for those posts
- Join the data in JavaScript instead of SQL

### 3. ‚úÖ Form Already Has Correct Structure
**Good News**: The FeedbackOnBehalfModal already has:
- ‚úÖ Customer details (email, name, company)
- ‚úÖ Feedback title and description (similar to Submit Feedback)
- ‚úÖ Priority selection
- ‚úÖ Source tracking
- ‚úÖ Internal notes field
- ‚úÖ Customer notification toggle

    ...
  },

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Board not found for this project"
**Solution**: Make sure your project has a board. Check the `boards` table in Supabase.

### Issue: Feedback doesn't appear on dashboard
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the `feedback_metadata` table exists
3. Check that the post was created in the `posts` table

### Issue: Internal notes not visible
**Solution**: Internal notes are only shown if you provided text in the "Internal Note" field when submitting.

### Issue: Customer not receiving notification
**Solution**:
1. Verify your email service is configured
2. Check the `/api/emails/feedback-on-behalf` endpoint exists
3. For now, notifications might not work until email template is created

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Email Template**: Create `/api/emails/feedback-on-behalf/route.ts`
2. **Filters**: Add filtering by priority, source, company on dashboard
3. **Search**: Add search functionality for feedback items
4. **Export**: Add CSV export for feedback on behalf
5. **Analytics**: Chart showing feedback trends by priority/source

## Files Modified in This Fix

1. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/feedback/on-behalf/route.ts` - Added board_id lookup
2. ‚úÖ `src/app/[slug]/settings/feedback/page.tsx` - Fixed query logic

The modal (`FeedbackOnBehalfModal.tsx`) was already correct and didn't need changes.
