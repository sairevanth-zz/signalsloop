# Moderation Controls & Customer Notifications - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Customer Email Notifications

**File**: `src/app/api/emails/feedback-on-behalf/route.ts`

When an admin submits feedback on behalf of a customer and checks "Notify customer via email", the customer receives a beautiful HTML email with:

- ✅ Gradient header with "Feedback Submitted" confirmation
- ✅ Personalized greeting with customer name
- ✅ Who submitted it (admin name)
- ✅ The feedback title and description in a highlighted box
- ✅ Call-to-action button to view the feedback board
- ✅ Professional footer with project name

**Email Service**: Uses Resend API (configured via `RESEND_API_KEY` env variable)

**Example Email Content**:
```
Hi John,

Thank you for your feedback! Sarah from our team has submitted
your feature request to our feedback board.

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

We appreciate your input and will keep you updated.
```

### 2. Moderation Controls (Delete Posts)

**API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/delete-post` (DELETE)

**Features**:
- ✅ Only project owners can delete posts
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Verifies project ownership before deletion
- ✅ Cascade deletes related data (comments, votes, etc.)
- ✅ Returns success/error messages

**UI Integration** (`src/app/[slug]/board/page.tsx`):
- ✅ Red trash icon button next to each post (only visible to project owners)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Instant UI update after deletion
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/error

### 3. Moderation Controls (Delete Comments)

**API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/delete-comment` (DELETE)

**Features**:
- ✅ Only project owners can delete comments
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Verifies project ownership
- ✅ Updates comment count on parent post after deletion
- ✅ Returns success/error messages

## How to Use

### Setup Email Notifications

1. **Get Resend API Key**:
   - Sign up at https://resend.com
   - Create an API key
   - Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   EMAIL_FROM="SignalsLoop <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
   ```

2. **Verify Domain** (for production):
   - Add your domain in Resend dashboard
   - Verify DNS records
   - For development, Resend provides a test domain

### Use Moderation Controls

#### Delete a Post:
1. Log in as project owner
2. Go to your project board
3. Find the post you want to delete
4. Click the red trash icon (🗑️) next to the status badge
5. Confirm the deletion
6. Post is immediately removed

#### Delete a Comment:
(Coming soon - will be added to post detail view)

## Security Features

### Authentication
- ✅ All moderation endpoints require valid session token
- ✅ Authorization header with Bearer token
- ✅ Validates user is logged in

### Authorization
- ✅ Verifies user owns the project before allowing any moderation action
- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't own the project
- ✅ Returns 401 Unauthorized if not logged in

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Cascade deletion ensures no orphaned data
- ✅ Updates related counts (e.g., comment_count on posts)
- ✅ Atomic operations to prevent partial deletions

## UI/UX Details

### Delete Button Visibility
- **Only shows for project owners**
- Hidden from regular users and anonymous visitors
- Uses `isProjectOwner` state to control visibility

### Confirmation Dialog
```javascript
"Are you sure you want to delete this post?
This action cannot be undone and will delete all
comments and votes associated with it."
```

### Toast Notifications
- ✅ Success: "Post deleted successfully" (green)
- ✅ Error: "Failed to delete post" (red)
- ✅ Unauthorized: "You must be logged in" (red)

### Visual Design
- Red trash icon (Trash2 from lucide-react)
- Hover effect: lighter red background
- Small button (sm size) to not overwhelm the UI
- Positioned next to status badge
