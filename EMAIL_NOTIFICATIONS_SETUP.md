3. Paste into the SQL editor
4. Click "Run" to create all tables, functions, and policies
5. Verify tables exist in the "Table Editor"

**Expected output:**
```

2. You'll see all sent emails with statuses:
   - ✅ **Delivered:** Email successfully sent
   - 📭 **Opened:** User opened the email (if tracking enabled)

```sql
-- View all sent emails
SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- View email counts by type
SELECT email_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM email_logs 
GROUP BY email_type;

-- View recent deliveries
SELECT to_email, email_type, sent_at, delivered_at 
FROM email_logs 
WHERE delivered_at IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Rate Limiting

Default: **5 emails per user per day**

To change the limit:
```typescript
// src/lib/email.ts (line 358)
const { data: rpcResult, error } = await supabase.rpc('check_email_rate_limit', {
  p_email: email,
  p_max_per_day: 10, // Change this number
});
```

### Email Sender

Default: `noreply@signalsloop.com`

To change:
```typescript
// src/lib/email.ts (line 549, 692, 835)
from: 'SignalsLoop <your-email@signalsloop.com>',
```

### Enable/Disable Specific Email Types

Emails are controlled by user preferences. Default settings:
- ✅ Status change emails: **ON**
- ✅ Comment reply emails: **ON**
- ✅ Vote milestone emails: **ON**
- ✅ Mention emails: **ON**
- ❌ Weekly digest: **OFF**

## 🎨 Customizing Email Templates

### Change Header Colors

```typescript
// Status Change (src/lib/email.ts line 486)
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); // Purple

// Comment (line 635)
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #10b981 0%, #059669 100%); // Green

// Confirmation (line 757)
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f59e0b 0%, #d97706 100%); // Orange
```

### Add Company Logo

```html
<!-- Add this inside any email template -->
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://www.signalsloop.com/logo.png" alt="SignalsLoop" style="height: 40px;">
  </td>
</tr>
```

### Customize Button Text

Search for button text in `src/lib/email.ts`:
- Line 525: "View Feedback"
- Line 668: "View Full Comment"
- Line 802: "📢 Share Feedback"
- Line 805: "View Post"

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

1. **Check Resend Dashboard:** https://resend.com/emails
   - Status should be "Delivered"
   - If "Bounced" → Email address invalid
   - If "Failed" → Check error message

2. **Check Spam Folder:**
   - First emails from new domains often go to spam
   - Mark as "Not Spam" to train Gmail

3. **Check Rate Limit:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_batches 
   WHERE to_email = 'user@example.com' 
   AND batch_date = CURRENT_DATE;
   ```
   - If `email_count >= 5`, rate limit hit

4. **Check Preferences:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_preferences 
   WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```
   - If `unsubscribed_at IS NOT NULL` → User unsubscribed
   - Check individual preference flags

5. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Check Vercel logs for errors
   vercel logs --prod | grep "email"
   ```

### Unsubscribe Page Not Working

1. **Check Token:**
   - Token must be valid (exists in `email_preferences` table)
   - Token format: 64-character hex string

2. **Check API:**
   ```bash
   curl https://www.signalsloop.com/api/email-preferences?token=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
   - Should return preferences and email

3. **Check Console:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Not Yet Implemented (Nice to Have)

1. **Vote Milestone Emails** (10, 25, 50 votes)
2. **Weekly Digest** (summary of all updates)
3. **Mention Notifications** (@ mentions in comments)
4. **Email Open Tracking** (Resend webhooks)
5. **Email Click Tracking** (UTM parameters)
6. **Admin Email Controls** (send manual emails to voters)
7. **Email Templates in Database** (editable templates)
8. **A/B Testing** (test different subject lines)

### How to Add Vote Milestone Emails

1. Create email template in `src/lib/email.ts`:
```typescript
export async function sendVoteMilestoneEmail(params: {
  toEmail: string;
  postTitle: string;
  voteCount: number;
  postUrl: string;
}) {
  // Email template here
}
```

2. Add trigger in post voting API:
```typescript
// src/app/api/posts/[id]/vote/route.ts
if (newVoteCount === 10 || newVoteCount === 25 || newVoteCount === 50) {
  await sendVoteMilestoneEmail({
    toEmail: post.author_email,
    postTitle: post.title,
    voteCount: newVoteCount,
    postUrl: `${APP_URL}/${projectSlug}/board?post=${postId}`,
  });
}
```

## ✅ Launch Checklist

Before going live with email notifications:

- [ ] Run SQL schema in Supabase
- [ ] Verify Resend domain is active
- [ ] Deploy to production (Vercel)
- [ ] Test all 3 email types
- [ ] Test unsubscribe page
- [ ] Verify emails don't go to spam
- [ ] Check Resend delivery logs
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours for bounces/errors

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always include unsubscribe links** (legal requirement)
2. **Keep emails under 100KB** (Gmail clips large emails)
3. **Use plain text fallback** (for email clients that don't support HTML)
4. **Monitor bounce rates** (>5% = problem)
5. **Respect user preferences** (honor opt-outs immediately)
6. **Rate limit aggressively** (prevent spam reputation damage)
7. **Use descriptive subject lines** (avoid "Update" or "Notification")
8. **Test on mobile** (60% of emails opened on mobile)
