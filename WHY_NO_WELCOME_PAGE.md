# Why You're Not Seeing the Welcome Page

## 🔍 The Reason

You're an **existing user**, not a new user. The welcome page with name collection is designed to show **only for new users** (those who created their account within the last 5 minutes).

Since you likely created your SignalsLoop account earlier, the system correctly skips the welcome page and sends you directly to the dashboard at `/app`.

---

## ✅ This is Expected Behavior!

The logic in `/auth/callback/route.ts` checks:

1. **Is this user brand new?** (created within last 5 minutes)
2. **Does the user have a name set?**

If **NO** to either → Show welcome page
If **YES** to both → Skip to dashboard

For your account:
- ❌ Created more than 5 minutes ago
- ✅ Probably has a name already set

**Result:** You go straight to `/app` (correct!)

## 🧪 How to Test the Welcome Page

### **Option 1: Visit Directly with Force Parameter** ⭐ EASIEST

Just navigate to:
```
https://signalsloop.com/welcome?force=true
```

This will show the name editor even if you're an existing user.

### **Option 2: Use a New Google Account**

1. Sign out from SignalsLoop
2. Use a **different Google account** you've never used with SignalsLoop
3. Sign in with Google
4. ✅ You should see the welcome page with name pre-filled

### **Option 3: Clear Your Name from Database**

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace with your actual email
UPDATE public.users
SET name = NULL
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

Then sign in again → Welcome page should appear

### **Option 4: Test with Magic Link**

1. Use a temporary email from [temp-mail.org](https://temp-mail.org)
2. Request magic link on SignalsLoop login
3. Click the link in the temp email
4. ✅ Should see welcome page

## 📊 Check Your User Status

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to see your current data:

```sql
-- Check your user record
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  name,
  created_at,
  NOW() - created_at as age
FROM public.users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

This will show:
- Your name (if set)
- When your account was created
- How old your account is

If `age` > 5 minutes → You won't see welcome page (expected)

## 🎯 Quick Test URLs

Once deployed, use these URLs to test:

1. **Force show name editor:**
   ```
   https://signalsloop.com/welcome?force=true
   ```

2. **Normal welcome page (will redirect if existing user):**
   ```
   https://signalsloop.com/welcome
   ```

3. **Dashboard (where existing users go):**
   ```
   https://signalsloop.com/app
   ```

## 🔧 Updated Code

I've made the following improvements:

1. **Extended time window** from 1 minute → 5 minutes
   - Handles OAuth delays better
   - More reliable detection

2. **Added database check** for name field
   - Shows welcome page if user has no name
   - Even for existing users without names

3. **Added `?force=true` parameter**
   - For testing purposes
   - Shows name editor regardless of user status

4. **Better logging**
   - Console logs show why user is/isn't seeing welcome page
   - Easier to debug
