# SignalsLoop Website Content Draft

## 1. Hero Section
**Headline:** The First AI-Native Product Operating System.
**Subheadline:** Stop managing tickets. Start managing signals. SignalsLoop actively hunts for user feedback, autonomously writes specs, and red-teams your roadmap—so you build the right thing, every time.
**CTA:** [Join the Waitlist] / [Get Early Access]
**Visual Idea:** A pulsating "brain" or "radar" visualization showing signals coming in from Twitter, Reddit, G2, being processed by agents, and turning into a roadmap.

## 2. The Problem
**Headline:** Your Product Tool is Passive. Your Market is Not.
**Copy:**
Traditional project management tools are just digital filing cabinets. They wait for you to input data. They don't know what your users are saying on Reddit. They don't warn you when a competitor launches a feature. They don't tell you if your last ship actually moved the needle.
**Key Pain Points:**
*   **Siloed Feedback:** User insights are scattered across Slack, Intercom, and social media.
*   **Manual Grunt Work:** PMs spend 50% of their time writing tickets and triaging bugs.
*   **Blind Spots:** You miss critical market shifts until it's too late.
