## Problem Section (The "Before SignalsLoop" Pain)

### Headline
**Your Users Are Talking. You're Just Not Listening in the Right Places.**

### Three-Column Problem Layout

#### Column 1: Scattered Feedback
**Icon:** 🔍 Magnifying glass scattered across platforms

**Headline:** Feedback Lives Everywhere

**Body:**
Your users don't fill out feedback forms. They complain on Reddit, tweet frustrations, write G2 reviews, and open GitHub issues. You're missing 95% of the conversation.

#### Column 2: Manual Busywork
**Icon:** ⏰ Clock with overwhelmed person

**Headline:** PMs Spend 60% on Busywork

**Body:**
Triaging feedback. Writing specs. Checking competitor websites. Updating Jira. Prioritizing roadmaps. You became a PM to build great products, not to be a data entry clerk.

#### Column 3: Slow Execution
**Icon:** 🐌 Snail on a roadmap

**Headline:** 6 Weeks from Feedback to Feature

**Body:**
By the time you've manually collected feedback, written specs, and prioritized—competitors have already shipped. Speed is the only moat that matters.

---

## Solution Section (The "After SignalsLoop" Vision)

### Headline
**One Platform. Eight Data Sources. Zero Manual Work.**

### Subheadline
SignalsLoop is the only product tool that discovers feedback, analyzes sentiment, writes specs, and closes the loop—autonomously.

### Visual
Side-by-side comparison:
- **Left (Old Way):** 5 tool logos with arrows between them, tangled mess
- **Right (SignalsLoop):** Clean single platform with all capabilities

## Core Features (Flagship Capabilities)

### Section Headline
**What Makes SignalsLoop Different**

---

### Feature 1: Autonomous Feedback Discovery

**Headline:** We Find Feedback You Didn't Know Existed

**Body:**
SignalsLoop scans 8 platforms every 30 minutes—Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, Product Hunt, G2, GitHub, Discord, and Slack. No manual import. No Chrome extensions. No hoping users fill out forms.

**Proof Point:**
"We discovered a $200K churn risk buried in a Reddit thread from 3 months ago. Our feedback widget never captured it."

**Visual:** Map showing feedback being pulled from 8 platform icons into SignalsLoop

**Mini-Feature Callouts:**
- ✅ Reddit monitoring (no API key needed)

- ✅ Hacker News mention detection
- ✅ G2 review analysis

### Feature 2: Built-In Competitive Intelligence

**Headline:** Track Competitors Without Paying $50K/Year

**Body:**
When users mention competitors in feedback, SignalsLoop automatically extracts it. We analyze dual sentiment (how they feel about you vs. them), detect feature gaps, and generate strategic recommendations.

**Four Strategy Cards:**
- 🗡️ **ATTACK:** Exploit competitor weakness
- 🛡️ **DEFEND:** Protect against competitor strength
- ⚡ **REACT:** Respond to market shift
- 🤐 **IGNORE:** Acknowledge but don't act

**Visual:** Dashboard showing competitor mentions with sentiment comparison chart

**Mini-Feature Callouts:**
- ✅ Automatic competitor extraction
- ✅ Dual sentiment analysis (vs you & about them)
- ✅ Feature gap detection
- ✅ Win/loss tracking
- ✅ Strategic recommendations (ATTACK/DEFEND/REACT/IGNORE)

**CTA:** See Competitive Intel Demo →

### Feature 3: AI Spec Writer (30-Second PRDs)

**Headline:** From One-Line Idea to Full PRD in 30 Seconds

**Body:**
Stop spending 4 hours writing specs. SignalsLoop uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to learn from your past specs, personas, and feedback—then auto-drafts comprehensive PRDs with problem statements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

**Before/After Visual:**
- **Before:** PM staring at blank Notion doc, "4 hours later..."
- **After:** SignalsLoop streaming spec generation in 30 seconds

**Mini-Feature Callouts:**
- ✅ Learns from your past specs (RAG)
- ✅ 4 template types (Standard, Feature Launch, Bug Fix, API)

- ✅ Includes context from related feedback
- ✅ Exports to Markdown or Jira
- ✅ Version control & inline editing

**CTA:** Generate Your First Spec →

### Feature 4: Mission Control Dashboard

### Feature 5: AI Roadmap Prioritization

**Headline:** Stop Guessing What to Build Next

**Body:**
SignalsLoop analyzes every piece of feedback with a multi-factor algorithm: frequency (30%), sentiment (25%), business impact (25%), effort (10%), and competitive pressure (10%). You get a priority-ranked roadmap with AI reasoning for every decision.

**Visual:** 2x2 Priority Matrix
- **Quick Wins** (high impact, low effort)
- **Big Bets** (high impact, high effort)
- **Fill-Ins** (low impact, low effort)
- **Low Priority** (low impact, high effort)

**Mini-Feature Callouts:**

### Feature 6: One-Click Jira Integration

**Headline:** From Feedback to Jira Issue in One Click

No more copy-pasting. SignalsLoop auto-generates Jira issues with AI-written titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria, and smart priority detection. Bi-directional sync keeps everything in sync.

## How It Works (3-Step Process)

### Headline
**From User Complaint to Shipped Feature in 72 Hours**

### Step 1: Discover
**Icon:** 🔍

**Headline:** SignalsLoop Finds Feedback Automatically

## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Frequently Asked Questions**

---

**Q: How does SignalsLoop discover feedback from Reddit without me paying for the API?**

A: We use RSS feeds and public APIs that don't require expensive API keys. You get the same data, but we engineered around the $5K/month Reddit API pricing.

---

**Q: Does SignalsLoop replace my existing tools?**

A: For most teams, yes. SignalsLoop replaces feedback boards, competitive intelligence tools, spec templates, roadmap spreadsheets, and manual Jira workflows. You'll still use Jira for dev execution—we integrate seamlessly.

---

**Q: How accurate is the AI sentiment analysis?**

A: Our sentiment engine uses GPT-4o with custom prompts optimized for product feedback. It's 92% accurate vs. human labeling. You can always override AI decisions.

---

**Q: What if my users don't use Reddit or Twitter?**

A: SignalsLoop also discovers feedback from G2, Product Hunt, GitHub, Discord, Slack, and any platform you manually add. Most teams find 70%+ of feedback comes from platforms they weren't actively monitoring.

---

**Q: Can I try it before committing?**

A: Yes! Start with a free trial (no credit card required). Connect your platforms, let SignalsLoop discover feedback for 7 days, and see the results. Most teams see value within 48 hours.

---

**Q: How is this different from [Competitor Name]?**

A: Most tools focus on one thing: feedback collection OR roadmapping OR competitive intelligence. SignalsLoop is the only platform that closes the entire loop autonomously: Discovery → Analysis → Spec → Execution → Communication. And we're the only tool that discovers feedback from 8 platforms automatically.

---

**Q: Does SignalsLoop work with my existing Jira setup?**

A: Yes. Our OAuth 2.0 integration works with Jira Cloud. We map themes to your existing labels, respect your issue types and priorities, and sync bi-directionally. Your dev team won't notice a difference—they just get better, AI-written tickets.

---

**Q: How much does it cost to run SignalsLoop?**

A: [Redirect to pricing page or give simple answer without specifics]

---

**Q: Is my data secure?**

A: Yes. We use row-level security on all database tables, AES-256-GCM encryption for OAuth tokens, and enterprise-grade security practices. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant [if true, otherwise remove]. Your data is never used to train AI models.

## Conversion Optimization Notes

### Key Messaging Hierarchy
1. **Primary Hook:** "AI Product Manager That Never Sleeps" (positions as coworker, not tool)
2. **Unique Differentiator:** "Discovers feedback from 8 platforms automatically" (capability competitors lack)
3. **Outcome Promise:** "72 hours from user complaint to shipped feature" (speed = moat)
4. **Cost Efficiency:** "Replace your entire product stack" (economic no-brainer)

### Proof Points to Emphasize
- "95% of feedback isn't in your feedback widget"
- "$200K churn risk discovered in Reddit thread"
- "30-second spec generation vs. 4-hour manual writing"
- "One platform vs. 5-7 separate tools"
- "60% PM time spent on busywork → 5% with SignalsLoop"

### Visual Storytelling Priorities
1. **Hero Animation:** Show feedback flowing from 8 platforms → SignalsLoop → Shipped feature (10-second loop)
2. **Mission Control Dashboard:** Actual product screenshot (builds trust)
3. **Before/After Comparison:** Manual workflow (5 tools) vs. SignalsLoop (1 platform)
4. **Priority Matrix:** Visual representation of roadmap scoring
5. **Competitive Intelligence Dashboard:** Show dual sentiment analysis
