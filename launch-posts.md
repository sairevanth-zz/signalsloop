### Title
SignalsLoop - AI Product Intelligence Platform That Builds Your Roadmap

### Tagline
Turn thousands of customer conversations into data-driven product decisions—automatically

### Description

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Revanth, and I'm launching **SignalsLoop** - the AI product intelligence platform that finally solves the feedback chaos every product team faces.

### **The Problem We're Solving**

Every Monday, PMs wake up to:
- 47 Slack messages about feature requests
- 23 support tickets buried in different tools
- 15 customer emails saying completely different things
- Sales notes from 8 calls that conflict with each other

By Friday, you've spent 15+ hours manually categorizing feedback, missed that "dark mode" was requested 47 times (using different words), and your roadmap is still a guess based on the loudest voices—not data.

### **Our Solution: AI That Does The Work For You**

SignalsLoop is the **only feedback platform with 5 proprietary AI models** that:

✅ **Auto-Categorize** - Instantly sorts feedback into bugs, features, improvements
✅ **Priority Score** - AI ranks urgency based on user impact, not volume
✅ **Duplicate Detection** - Finds "dark mode," "dark theme," "night mode" as the same request
✅ **Smart Replies** - Suggests context-aware responses to users
✅ **AI Writing Assistant** - Helps craft roadmap updates and changelogs

### **What Makes Us Different**

🎯 **Public Feedback Boards** - Give users a place to share ideas and vote (not buried tickets)
🗺️ **Shareable Roadmap** - Show customers you're listening with a public Kanban board
💬 **Two-Way Conversations** - Real-time communication with thousands of users at scale
📊 **Data-Driven Decisions** - AI generates your roadmap based on patterns, not guesses

### **Pricing That Makes Sense**

- **Free Forever**: All 5 AI features included (10 requests/day limit)
- **Pro**: $19/month for unlimited AI + unlimited boards + webhooks + API

Compare that to Canny ($99/mo), ProductBoard ($59/user/mo), or Aha! Ideas ($59/user/mo) - **we're 80-93% cheaper** with AI features they don't have.

### **Why We Built This**

As indie makers and startup founders, we were drowning in feedback from users. Tools like Canny were $300/month but still required manual work. ProductBoard was complex and expensive. We needed something that:

1. **Actually used AI** (not just buzzword marketing)
2. **Didn't cost $3,000+/year**
3. **Helped us have conversations with users, not just collect data**

So we built SignalsLoop.

### **Try It Now - Free Forever**

🔗 **[Start Free](https://signalsloop.com)** - No credit card, all 5 AI features included
🎬 **[Live Demo](https://signalsloop.com/demo/board)** - See the public board + roadmap in action

### **What We'd Love Feedback On**

1. Does the AI categorization match how you'd organize feedback manually?
2. Are there other AI features you'd want to see?
3. What integrations matter most? (We have Slack, Discord, webhooks, API)

Thanks for checking us out! Happy to answer any questions. 🚀

## 💼 LinkedIn Launch Announcement

### Post 1: Main Launch Announcement

🚀 **Launching SignalsLoop: The AI Product Intelligence Platform**

After 12 months of building, we're going live today.

**The problem:** Product teams are drowning in feedback.

47 Slack messages. 23 support tickets. 15 customer emails. 8 sales call notes.

All saying different things. All scattered across tools.

PMs spend 15+ hours/week manually categorizing feedback. They miss patterns. "Dark mode" gets requested 47 times, but using different words ("dark theme," "night mode," "eye-friendly display"), so it stays buried.

By Friday, the roadmap is a guess based on the loudest voices—not data.

**The solution:** AI that does the work for you.

SignalsLoop uses 5 proprietary AI models to:
→ Auto-categorize every piece of feedback (bug, feature, improvement)
→ Score priority based on user impact, not just volume
→ Detect duplicates across different phrasings
→ Draft smart replies to keep users in the loop
→ Help you write roadmap updates

**What you get:**
✅ Public feedback boards where thousands of users share ideas
✅ Embeddable widget for your site/app
✅ Shareable roadmap (Kanban view) so customers see you're listening
✅ Two-way conversations at scale, not buried support tickets
✅ Data-driven product decisions in seconds, not weeks

**Pricing that makes sense:**
• Free: All 5 AI features (10/day limit)
• Pro: $19/month unlimited

Compare: Canny ($99/mo), ProductBoard ($59/user/mo), Aha! ($59/user/mo)
→ We're 80-93% cheaper with AI features they don't have.

**Who it's for:**
Indie makers, solo founders, early-stage startups who need enterprise-grade product intelligence—without the $3,000+/year price tag.

We'd love your feedback. What AI features would help you ship better products?

### Post 2: Behind-the-Scenes Story (Personal)

**Why I built SignalsLoop** 🧵

6 months ago, my CEO asked: "What should we build next?"

I had 500 feedback items across Slack, email, support tickets, and call notes.

I spent the entire week manually reading, categorizing, and prioritizing.

By Friday, I was exhausted. My roadmap? A guess based on who shouted loudest.

That's when I realized: **This is every PM's nightmare.**

So I asked: What if AI could do all of this?

Not just organize feedback—but actually:
• Read every conversation
• Identify patterns across different phrasings
• Score priorities based on real impact
• Tell you what to build next
• Keep users in the loop automatically

That's SignalsLoop.

**The AI Product Intelligence Platform That Builds Your Roadmap For You.**

We're live today: https://signalsloop.com

Free plan includes all 5 AI features. No credit card needed.

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by feedback, this is for you.

### Post 3: Announcement for Founders/Indie Makers

📢 **Indie makers: Stop paying $300/month for feedback tools that still make you do manual work.**

I just launched SignalsLoop—the AI-first feedback platform built specifically for us.

**Here's what you get for $19/month:**

🤖 5 AI models that auto-categorize, prioritize, find duplicates, draft replies, and tell you what to build

🎯 Public feedback boards where users vote on features (with urgency levels)

🗺️ Shareable roadmap so customers see you're listening

📊 CSV import/export, webhooks, API, Slack & Discord integration

**Compare that to:**
• Canny: $99/month, no AI auto-categorization
• ProductBoard: $59/user/month ($295+ for a 5-person team)
• Aha! Ideas: $59/user/month

**We're literally 5-15x cheaper** and have AI features they don't.

**Best part?** Free plan includes ALL 5 AI features (10 requests/day).

No credit card. No time limit. Upgrade only when you love it.

Built by an indie maker, for indie makers. Let's ship better products together. 🚀

### Post 4: Problem-Agitate-Solution (For Maximum Engagement)

**Real talk: Your roadmap is probably wrong.**

Not because you're bad at your job.

Because you're building based on:
❌ The loudest customers (not the majority)
❌ Whoever emailed you most recently
❌ What your CEO's golf buddy mentioned
❌ Features that "feel right"

**Here's what you actually need:**

✅ Every piece of feedback, automatically categorized
✅ Duplicates merged (even when worded differently)
✅ Priority scores based on real user impact
✅ Patterns identified across thousands of conversations
✅ A data-driven roadmap that shows what matters most

**That's what AI can do.**

And that's exactly what SignalsLoop does—for $19/month.

We launched today: https://signalsloop.com

**Free plan includes all 5 AI features.** No BS. No credit card.

Stop guessing. Start shipping what users actually want.
